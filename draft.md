# Draft Implementation Plan - Immediate Next Steps

Based on the structure.md and todo list.md, the immediate next steps to get the advertisement system started are:

1. **Database Setup:**
    - [ ] Review and finalize the database schema defined in structure.md, especially for ad_positions, advertisements, and ad_statistics tables.
    - [ ] Create the database and tables in MySQL using the provided SQL schema. This might involve using a tool like phpMyAdmin or executing SQL commands directly.
    - [ ] Configure the database connection in `config/database.php` with the correct credentials (host, username, password, database name).

2. **Basic MVC Framework Setup:**
    - [ ] Create core MVC files and directories if they are not already present:
        - `src/Models/` (for Model classes)
        - `src/Controllers/` (for Controller classes)
        - `templates/` (for View templates)
    - [ ] Ensure the autoloader in `index.php` is correctly set up to load classes from `src/Controllers`, `src/Models`, `src/Services`, and `src/Utils` directories based on their namespaces (e.g., `App\Controllers`, `App\Models`, etc.).
    - [ ] Create a basic `BaseController.php` in `src/Controllers/` that can be extended by other controllers to handle common functionalities.
    - [ ] Create a basic `BaseModel.php` in `src/Models/` for common model functionalities and database interactions.

3. **Admin Authentication Setup:**
    - [ ] Implement basic admin authentication to protect the admin panel.
    - [ ] Create an `AdminController.php` with a login action and a dashboard action.
    - [ ] Create login and dashboard view templates in `templates/admin/`.
    - [ ] Configure routes in `config/routes.php` for admin login and dashboard, pointing to the `AdminController`.

4. **Ad Position Management (Admin Panel - Basic CRUD):**
    - [ ] Create `AdPosition.php` model in `src/Models/` to interact with the `ad_positions` table. Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    - [ ] Implement Ad Position management actions in `AdminController.php` (e.g., `listPositions`, `createPosition`, `editPosition`, `deletePosition`).
    - [ ] Create view templates in `templates/admin/` for listing, creating, and editing ad positions.
    - [ ] Configure routes in `config/routes.php` to map URLs like `/admin/positions`, `/admin/positions/create`, `/admin/positions/edit/{id}`, etc., to the corresponding actions in `AdminController`.

These steps will lay the foundation for the advertisement system. We will start with database and basic framework setup, then implement admin authentication and ad position management as the first manageable features in the admin panel.

Next, I will create `todo list.md` with the long-term goals extracted from `structure.md`.
